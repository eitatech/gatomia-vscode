# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Server Integration for Hooks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: December 5, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Review Details**:

- Content is technology-agnostic, focusing on user needs and business value
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 6 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 3 prioritized user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- 6 edge cases identified covering key failure scenarios
- Scope is bounded to MCP server integration with hooks
- Dependencies clearly stated (requires MCP servers configured in Copilot)

**Readiness**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase of development.
