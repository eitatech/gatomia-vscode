# Specification Quality Checklist: MCP Hooks Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-05  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items passed on initial review
- The specification builds on the existing Hooks Module (001-hooks-module) and specifically addresses the MCP integration aspect mentioned in User Story 4 of that specification
- Assumptions clearly document that MCP servers must already be configured and working with Copilot before use in hooks
- Edge cases cover schema changes, large payloads, timeouts, authentication, and concurrent execution scenarios
