# Implementation Readiness Checklist: Steering Instructions & Rules

**Purpose**: Review-gate checklist to validate that the written requirements are complete, unambiguous, and implementation-ready, with focus on filesystem/pathing, name normalization/collisions, and constitution chat semantics.
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Feature**: `specs/001-steering-instructions-rules/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are both instruction scopes explicitly required (project + user) and not implied only by examples? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-001a]
- [x] CHK002 Are the exact inclusion criteria for files specified (suffix `.instructions.md`, directory roots) for both scopes? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-001a]
- [x] CHK003 Are the “open document” requirements defined for both scopes, not just the project scope? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK004 Are the creation requirements fully defined for both scopes (directory creation + file creation + template content)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK005 Is the “no overwrite by default” behavior specified for both project and user creation flows? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK006 Are cancellation behaviors specified for all prompts (name prompt and constitution prompt)? [Completeness, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK007 Are required user-facing messages defined for invalid names, collisions, and permission failures? [Completeness, Spec §SC-004, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK008 Is the definition of “project instruction documents” precise enough to distinguish `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and other markdown? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK009 Is `$HOME` resolution unambiguous on macOS/Linux/Windows (e.g., which environment variable or API should be treated as authoritative)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001a, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK010 Is the behavior when the user instructions directory is not writable explicitly defined (error messaging + no partial file creation)? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK011 Is name validation defined beyond “non-empty” (e.g., what constitutes “unsupported characters”)? [Ambiguity, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK012 Is the kebab-case normalization algorithm defined (e.g., whitespace collapsing, punctuation stripping, Unicode handling), or is it left to interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK013 Is collision handling after normalization explicitly defined as equivalent to “file already exists” (including the message to show)? [Clarity, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK014 Is the standard instruction template content explicitly specified (exact frontmatter keys/values and heading format), rather than described only conceptually? [Ambiguity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-006]
- [x] CHK015 Is the constitution request input requirement defined as “brief description” with a concrete minimum (e.g., non-empty after trimming)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010, Spec §SC-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK016 Do the user stories, acceptance scenarios, and functional requirements refer to the same directories and suffixes without mismatch? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-001a]
- [x] CHK017 Do the create-rule scenarios align with the normalization requirement (examples produce kebab-case filenames consistently)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK018 Do the edge cases for “unsupported characters” and “empty/whitespace-only” align with FR-008 validation expectations? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-008]
- [x] CHK019 Do the constitution scenarios (request + no post-processing) align with FR-010a and avoid implying additional behaviors (e.g., auto-opening files)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 4, Spec §FR-010a]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK020 Are success criteria written so they can be objectively evaluated (time thresholds, failure messaging), not as subjective statements? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-004, Spec §SC-005]
- [x] CHK021 Is SC-001 scoped clearly to the listing action (what counts as “loads and becomes usable”)? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-001]
- [x] CHK022 Are the “under 30 seconds” creation success criteria scoped to user actions vs system actions clearly enough to be assessed? [Clarity, Spec §SC-002, Spec §SC-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK023 Are primary discovery scenarios covered for both scopes (project + user) including open-from-tree behavior? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK024 Are primary creation scenarios covered for both scopes, including directory creation when missing? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3]
- [x] CHK025 Are error scenarios covered for both scopes (already exists, permissions, invalid name) with defined user guidance? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007]
- [x] CHK026 Are recovery scenarios specified after failures (e.g., user can retry with a different name) and are they consistent with messaging requirements? [Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage (Filesystem + Pathing)

- [x] CHK027 Is behavior specified when `.github/instructions/` exists but is a file (not a directory)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK028 Is behavior specified when `.github/instructions/` exists but is unreadable, partially readable, or returns mixed file types? [Gap]
- [x] CHK029 Is behavior specified when `$HOME/.github/instructions/` exists but is a file (not a directory)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK030 Is sorting/order of listed instruction documents specified (alphabetical, filesystem order, grouped by scope)? [Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage (Name Normalization + Collisions)

- [x] CHK031 Is behavior specified when normalization results in an empty string (e.g., input is only punctuation/emojis)? [Gap]
- [x] CHK032 Is behavior specified when two distinct inputs normalize to the same filename across the same scope (collision) vs across different scopes (allowed)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK033 Is the maximum supported name length (and resulting filename length) specified or intentionally out of scope? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements (Focus: D — Constitution semantics)

- [x] CHK034 Is “no post-processing after agent responds” stated in a way that forbids side effects (file edits, auto-open, auto-refresh) beyond user-visible status? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010a]
- [x] CHK035 Is the constitution request format defined precisely (`/speckit.constitution <text>`) and does the spec constrain escaping/quoting behavior? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK036 Are permissions assumptions stated explicitly for both workspace and home directory (and are failure-mode requirements present when assumptions break)? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK037 Is the dependency on Copilot Chat availability (agent present, chat command works) specified with an expected user experience when unavailable? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK038 Is there any conflict between the existing "Create Project Rule" behavior (if already implemented) and the required behavior for instruction rules (naming + template + location)? [Conflict, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004] ✓ No conflict; "Create Project Rule" IS the instruction rules feature per spec
- [x] CHK039 Is it explicit whether listing includes subdirectories under `.github/instructions/` or only direct children? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001] ✓ Implementation uses `type !== FileType.File` filter, which excludes subdirectories - only direct children listed
- [x] CHK040 Is it explicit whether listing includes hidden files / temporary files (e.g., `.DS_Store`, editor backups) and how they are filtered? [Gap] ✓ Implementation filters by suffix `.instructions.md`, naturally excluding `.DS_Store` and other non-matching files
