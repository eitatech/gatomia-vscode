# Proposal: Show Project Instructions in Prompts View

## Summary
Update the Prompts view to include files from `.github/instructions` in addition to `.github/prompts`.
This change aims to make instruction files easily accessible from the IDE side panel.

## Motivation
Currently, the Prompts view only shows files from `.github/prompts`. Users also need to access instruction files located in `.github/instructions`.

## Solution
We will separate the view into distinct categories for Prompts and Instructions to provide a clear organization.
